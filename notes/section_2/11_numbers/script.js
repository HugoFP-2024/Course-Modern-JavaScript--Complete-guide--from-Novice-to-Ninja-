// Numbers
// Math Operators: +, -, *, /, **, %

// Nan - Not a Number: It is the result of a calculation that, does not result in a number.

let circleRadius = 10;
const pi = 3.14;

// Shorthand Operators:

console.log(++circleRadius);     
// It's the same as 'circleRadius = circleRadius + 1', also works with subtraction 
// Note: Using the '++' or otehr operator before OR after the variable, actually makes a diference!

console.log(circleRadius += 10)  
// Takes the current value of 'circleRadius' and add 10. Also works with other operators, like -, *, /, %
