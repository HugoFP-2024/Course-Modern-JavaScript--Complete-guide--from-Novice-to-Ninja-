// The biggest difference between 'null' and 'undefined' is that undefined is assigned to a variable that was not given an initial value, while null is explicitly assigned to a variable.

// Note: If you add something, like the number 3 to an 'undefined' value, it will become NaN, but if you add 3 to 'null', it will become 3.
